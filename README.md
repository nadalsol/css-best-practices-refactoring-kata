# CSS Best Practices Refactoring Kata

## Overview

- I see junior and senior devs. suffering with CSS over time, also hating it üò©
- We all know CSS can be hard to debug ü§î üêû
- CSS is a core pillar of the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).
- CSS is awesome! You just need to understand how it works (as any other language).

## Kata Purpose

- Promote code reusability, scalability and maintainability.
- Enjoy writing good CSS code, using something standard (no over complexities).
- Embrace CSS ‚ô•Ô∏è

## Tech Stack

- This Kata works with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), as the later is [kind of an industry standard](https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/other-tools/). Also because its learning curve is lower than other tools.
- There are other options out there to deal with CSS: pre-processors (Sass, Less‚Ä¶), post-processors (PostCSS), frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, Foundation‚Ä¶), CSS Modules, CSS in JS (Styled components, Emotion‚Ä¶), etc‚Ä¶
- If you prefer to write this Kata with plain/vanilla CSS, feel free to do it\*

(\*) Just write plain CSS within the existing `.scss` files and the code should work üòâ

## Keep in mind

- This is a refactoring Kata so please **focus on improving the CSS code**, not the UI _look&feel_.
